    <h1>GROUNDS FOR PEACE</h1>
    <p><strong>Restoring the Earth, Restoring the Body</strong></p>

    <h2>Mission:</h2>
    <p>
      Grounds for Peace is a transdisciplinary initiative healing the disconnection between people, place, and possibility. We understand that widespread disregard for the body is not incidental, but woven into the built, social, and ecological fabric of a society shaped by settler violence, genocide, trafficking, torture, and the normalization of harm. This abuse has been etched into the neurological, infrastructural, and institutional patterns of life in North America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet our humanity remains. We reclaim it through living design, somatic integrity, and systemic redirection. Grounds for Peace develops programs and catalyzes redesigns across ecological infrastructure, agriculture, education, somatics, built environments, and environmental remediation. Our work supports the thriving of both the Earth and the living body‚Äînot as separate, but as co-constitutive grounds of life.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Work</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Somatic Coregulation for Families, Couples & Groups</strong><br/>
        In-person sessions held in nature for co-regulation, embodied healing, and integrative awareness. These sessions reject pathologizing models of health and center each participant in their inherent wisdom, sensory intelligence, and right to feel good. <em>‚ÄúYou are not broken. You are responding. Let‚Äôs respond together.‚Äù</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Living Infrastructure</strong><br/>
        We facilitate cross-sector design conversations to design replacements of physically injurious, rigid urban ground‚Äîconcrete sidewalks and asphalt roads‚Äîwith shock-absorbent, water-conductive, tree-root-cooperative surfaces. We also advocate for the replacement of harmful auditory signals‚Äîsuch as sirens and vehicle backup alarms which damage human nervous systems and fetal development‚Äîwith alternatives that promote rather than destroy health. Our vision is infrastructural development that supports biomechanical health, environmental resilience, and enjoying our humanity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Regenerative Agriculture</strong><br/>
        We advocate for a full transition from nutricidal‚Äìagricultural and industrial use of toxic chemicals which harm people‚Äôs health‚Äîto nutritious food systems‚Äîrestoring soil, plant, and human vitality while supporting place-based agricultural wisdom and necessities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Education Without Harm</strong><br/>
        We reimagine learning environments by calling for the abolition of physical harm (including forced stillness and chronic sitting) as a basis for education. We support postural freedom, somatic learning, and sensory-responsive environments in schools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Environmental Remediation & Systems Debriefing</strong><br/>
        We convene scientists, Indigenous land stewards, and affected communities to review and refine methods of remediation for toxic soil, air, and water. Our goal is coordinated, culturally accountable, ecologically sound responses to contamination and climate collapse.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rest & Mobility Innovation</strong><br/>
        We develop ergonomic, somatically sound humane consoles for computing, rest, and transport‚Äîprototypes that free the body from lower spinal and pelvic immobilization of chairs and reclaim non-sitting forms of supported rest, navigation, and digital interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Upgrade Building & Design Codes</strong><br/>
        We advocate for the revision of architectural, interior, and product design standards to support lifelong neuromusculoskeletal health. Emphasis is placed on accommodating transverse plane mobility in the hip joints to prevent disablement from chronic overrotation, particularly when turning or walking around corners in confined spaces such as showers, and spatial relationships between doorways and necessary pivots of turning around corners.
        <br/><br/>
        We also promote ergonomic reforms which normalize adjustable surface heights in domestic, educational, and workplace environments‚Äîensuring that people of varying statures can interact safely with furniture, fixtures, and tools. This includes elevating common appliances such as ovens and dishwashers to hip height or higher, and eliminating drawers or shelving systems positioned below the hip, which require repeated forward flexion and torque at vulnerable angles. Standards should also reflect inclusive height clearances, including ceiling fans and lighting fixtures that do not pose collision risks for taller individuals.
