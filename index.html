    <h2>Mission:</h2>
    <p>
      Grounds for Peace is a transdisciplinary initiative healing the disconnection between people, place, and possibility.
      We develop programs and catalyze system redesigns across ecological infrastructure, education, agriculture, environmental remediation, and somatics.
      Our work supports the thriving of both the Earth and the living body‚Äînot as separate, but as co-constitutive grounds of life.

    <h2>OUR WORK</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Somatic Coregulation for Families, Couples & Groups</strong><br>
        In-person sessions held in nature for co-regulation, embodied healing, and integrative awareness.
        These sessions reject pathologizing models of health and center each participant in their inherent wisdom,
        sensory intelligence, and right to feel good.<br>
        <em>‚ÄúYou are not broken. You are responding. Let‚Äôs respond together.‚Äù</em>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Living Infrastructure</strong><br>
        We facilitate cross-sector design conversations to replace toxic, rigid urban ground (like concrete sidewalks)
        with shock-absorbent, water-conductive, tree-root-sensitive surfaces. Our vision is walkable infrastructure that supports
        biomechanical health, environmental resilience, and rooted beauty.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Regenerative Agriculture</strong><br>
        We advocate for a full transition from nutricidal to nutritious food systems‚Äîrestoring soil, plant, and human vitality
        while supporting Black, Indigenous, and place-based agricultural wisdom.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Education Without Harm</strong><br>
        We reimagine learning environments by calling for the abolition of physical harm (including forced stillness and chronic sitting)
        as a basis for education. We support postural freedom, somatic learning, and sensory-responsive environments in schools.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Environmental Remediation & Systems Debriefing</strong><br>
        We convene scientists, Indigenous land stewards, and affected communities to review and refine methods of remediation
        for toxic soil, air, and water. Our goal is coordinated, culturally accountable, ecologically sound responses to contamination
        and climate collapse.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Rest & Mobility Innovation</strong><br>
        We develop ergonomic, somatically sound ‚Äúhuman consoles‚Äù for computing, rest, and transport‚Äîprototypes that free the body
        from rigid chairs and reclaim non-sitting forms of supported rest, co-navigation, and digital interface.
      </li>
