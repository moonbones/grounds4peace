    <p>Grounds for Peace is a transdisciplinary humanitarian and technological initiative re-engineering the interface between human bodies, public infrastructure, and planetary systems. We unite somatic intelligence, quantum materials research, and ecological design to create infrastructures that sustain life without harm. Our work bridges deep embodiment with high-level technological innovation to prototype new ground systems—moisture-conductive sidewalks, regenerative urban surfaces, trauma-free emergency signaling, and self-generating water stations.</p>

    <p>By aligning humanitarian ethics with material science and design, we build pathways toward infrastructures that feel, breathe, and support human and planetary well-being.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <div class="media-container">
      <img src="images/B6E80EE3-23F5-43F1-BB9F-8BAFB27ECF57_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="Harmful Infrastructure or Body-Environment Interaction">
    </div>
    <p>The infrastructures that hold our daily lives—roads, schools, workplaces, and emergency systems—have been designed around mechanical efficiency, not biological integrity. These environments injure the spine, compress the lungs, distort gait, overload the nervous system, and contribute to the climate emergency through toxic, rigid materials.</p>
    <p>This is not accidental. It reflects an inherited design paradigm that normalizes harm—rooted in extractive economics and disembodied science. The result is a civilization whose built environments reproduce trauma at both cellular and planetary scales.</p>
    <p>Grounds for Peace exists to reverse this logic. We are developing a framework for Living Infrastructure: systems designed with the body as a reference point and the Earth as collaborator. Our aim is to restore somatic coherence at the infrastructural level—to make cities, tools, and materials that support life instead of degrading it.</p>

  <section id="approach">
    <h2>Transdisciplinary Approach</h2>
    <div class="media-container">
      <img src="images/Communication.PNG" alt="Diagram or Conceptual Image">
    </div>
    <p>We work at the intersection of somatics, physics, design, and ecology, translating principles of embodied intelligence into the language of material innovation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Somatic Intelligence:</strong> The human body as sensor, feedback loop, and design guide.</li>
      <li><strong>Quantum & Nano Inquiry:</strong> Collaboration with scientists exploring matter at micro and sub-atomic levels to identify possibilities for regenerative materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Ecological Design:</strong> Translating micro-level coherence into macro-level infrastructure: roads, buildings, and soundscapes that integrate hydrological balance, soil health, and postural integrity.</li>
      <li><strong>Humanitarian Alignment:</strong> Every prototype—whether a sidewalk, signal, or interface—reduces harm and increases vitality for bodies, communities, and ecosystems alike.</li>
    </ul>
